/*  Functions to simulate interaction with an ADXL362 accelerometer.
    Writing a value to an accelerometer register will change the
    register if the register is read-write.
    Reading most of the accelerometer registers gives the reset value,
    or the most recent value that you have written to that register.
    The acceleration registers give false values for acceleration:
    X = -345 mg, Z = 876 mg, Y varies in the range +/- 1100 mg.

    To use these functions in CodeBlocks, put these files in the
    project folder: libADXL362sim.a, ADXL362sim.h, typedefs.h.
    On the Project menu, choose Build Options.  Change the
    Linker Settings to add the library file libADXL362sim.a
    Answer No when asked if you want to keep this as a relative path.
    Alternatively, if you want to keep it as a relative path, add
    .\ so that the library file appears as .\libADXL362sim.a
    In your main program, #include this header file and typedefs.h.

    To use these functions in Keil uVision, put these files in the
    project folder: ADXL362sim.lib, ADXL362sim.h.
    Also typedefs.h if you do not have the type definitions
	already (they are in the DES_M0_SoC.h file).
    Add ADXL362sim.lib as a source file in the project.
    In your main program, #include this header file and also
		typedefs.h if you need it.
